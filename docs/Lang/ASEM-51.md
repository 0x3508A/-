## What is ASEM-51 ?

> ASEM-51 is a two-pass macro assembler for the Intel MCS-51 family of microcontrollers. It is running on the PC under MS-DOS, Windows and Linux. The ASEM-51 assembly language is based on the standard Intel syntax, and implements conditional assembly, macros, and include file processing. The assembler can output object code in Intel-HEX or Intel OMF-51 format as well as a detailed list file. The ASEM-51 package includes support for more than two hundred 8051 derivatives, a bootstrap program for MCS-51 target boards, and documentation in ASCII and HTML format. And it is free ...

## Features

ASEM-51 is a two-pass macro assembler for the Intel MCS-51 family of microcontrollers. It is running on the PC under MS-DOS, Windows and Linux. The ASEM-51 assembly language is a rich subset of the Intel standard that guarantees maximum compatibility with existing 8051 assembler sources. ASEM-51 can generate two sorts of object files: Intel-HEX format, which is directly accepted by most EPROM programmers, and absolute OMF-51 format, which is required for many simulators, emulators and target debuggers. Thus ASEM-51 is suitable for small and medium MCS-51-based microcontroller projects in hobby, education and business. However, ASEM-51 has been designed to process also very large programs!

Its most important features are:

- fast, compact, reliable, easy to use, and well-documented
- easy installation, almost no configuration required
- command line operation, batch and networking capability
- DOS (RM and PM), Win32 and Linux binaries available
- Intel-compatible syntax
- five location counters, one for each of the MCS-51 address spaces
- assembly-time evaluation of arithmetic and logical expressions
- segment type checking for instruction operands
- automatic code optimization of generic jumps and calls
- macro processing (that really works)
- nested include file processing
- nested conditional assembly
- absolute OMF-51 module output (with debug information)
- Intel-HEX file output
- hex-to-binary conversion utility
- built-in symbols for 8051 special function registers (can be disabled)
- direct support for more than two hundred 8051 derivatives
- support of user-defined 8051 derivatives
- special support for the Philips P83C75x family
- 8051 register bank support
- detailed assembler listing with symbol table or cross reference
- further fancy printing facilities   (smile)
- documentation in ASCII and HTML format
- bootstrap program for testing on the MCS-51 target board
- support for easy integration into the popular Borland IDE (for DOS)
- limited update service by the author
