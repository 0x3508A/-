## Single Command to convert Markdown files to Org Mode

[Link](https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/5465)

Reference:

- <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/q/5465>
- <https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/5465/how-to-migrate-markdown-files-to-emacs-org-mode-format>

Here is a single Command that can convert all Markdown files into Org Mode format:

```sh
find . -name \*.md -type f -exec pandoc  -f markdown -t org -o {}.org {} \;
```

Of course you would need to have `pandoc` installed first.

On Windows it would become really difficult.

## `clang-format` - Code Formatting of the open source

Home Page : <https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html>

Video explaining how to go about installing in **Windows**:

- Need LLVM Builds page for downloading LLVM tools <https://llvm.org/builds/>

- Got to `clang-format plugin for Visual Studio` on the builds page.

In `ubuntu` **Linux** :
```sh
sudo apt install clang-format
```

VS Code extensions for `clang-format` :

## Rob Pike's 5 Rules of Programming

<https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html>


- Rule 1.

    You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks
    occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a
    speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.

- Rule 2.

    Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then
    don't unless one part of the code overwhelms the rest.

- Rule 3.

    Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small.
    Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that n is
    frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if n does get big,
    use Rule 2 first.)

- Rule 4.

    Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder
    to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.

- Rule 5.

    Data dominates.

    If you've chosen the right data structures and
    organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident.

    Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.

Pike's rules 1 and 2 restate **Tony Hoare's** famous maxim

***"Premature optimization is the root of all evil."***

Ken Thompson rephrased Pike's rules 3 and 4 as
**"When in doubt, use brute force."**.

Rules 3 and 4 are instances of the ***design philosophy KISS***.

Rule 5 was previously stated by *Fred Brooks* in **The Mythical Man-Month**.

Rule 5 is often shortened to ***"write stupid code that uses smart objects"***.
