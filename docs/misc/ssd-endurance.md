# SSD Endurance

This is the measure of how long the SSD is going to last.
A very key limit on te use of SSDs.

There are two Measures:

1. TBW = Terabytes Written

    This measures the total amount of data that can be written
    to the disk before it fails.

    For Example:

    Look at [Crucial P3 Plus 500GB PCIe M.2 2280 SSD](https://www.crucial.com/ssd/p3-plus/CT500P3PSSD8)

    Model No. [`CT500P3PSSD8`](https://www.crucial.com/ssd/p3-plus/CT500P3PSSD8)

    `SSD Endurance (TBW) 	110TB`

    Means that 110 Terabytes can be written to this SSD before it
    gets damaged permanently.

2. DWPD = Disk-Writes Per Day

    This is number of days the SSD would last when the Full capacity of the SSD
    is written in a Day.

    It's a but convoluted but let us try to understand with an example.

    Let's say an SSD Endurance says `100 DWPD` and the SSD has `500GB` capacity.

    This means that if `500GB` is written every day to the SSD then it would
    last for `100 days`.

    Hence the total `SSD Endurance (TBW) = 500GB * 100Days / 1000GB = 50TBW`
    Well that's too less yes, that is true.
