# Cryptool Android

Cryptool is a cryptography tool and high security keystore app for Android.

It can be used as a floating tool and in ball/bubble mode.

It has been developed keeping in mind these three words: fast, small and offline.

## Thoughts

It can store **various AES-256 keys** secured by a **master-password**.

Then once can use each to convert plain text to encrypted and BASE64
encoded text.

One can use particular keys for each site.

This tool also provides SHA-256 hashing for text. That can be
used to sign messages.
