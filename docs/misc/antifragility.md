# Antifragility : Wisdom of the Strong

## Concept of Antifragility
Antifragility is a property of systems in which they increase in capability to thrive as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures.

Simply, antifragility is defined as a convex response to a stressors or source of harm (for some range of variation), leading to a positive sensitivity to increase in volatility (or variability, stress, dispersion of outcomes, or uncertainty, what is grouped under the designation "disorder cluster"). Likewise fragility is defined as a concave sensitivity to stressors, leading to a negative sensitivity to increase in volatility. The relation between fragility, convexity, and sensitivity to disorder is mathematical, obtained by theorem, not derived from empirical data mining or some
historical narrative. It is a priory.

Rather than eliminate uncertainty and noise, can a system of programming be built that benefits from it? More like human Muscle training.

## Examples

- Infrastructure and Knowledge Base.
- #Rust Language
    - Deterministic Destruction
    - Transparent ownership
    - Algebraic Data Type (ADT) Support
- Monorepo
    - Bazel instead of Cargo - Not for the faint of heart
- We should work together to build common solutions, instead of individually reinventing the wheel.
