Merits:

- Nice one but there is a need to switch to a new Markup format.
- The concept of single file based thing is really nice. We can easily sync or move data. In fact even images or files attached are actually stored inside the same HTML file.
- We can also attach files from the disk.
- When this is compared to the Cherry tree this scores well.
- Being a single file its easy to make portable and share. It can easily be zipped and emailed to other people.
- Excellent multi-platform capability. Can even work on mobile without any app. However editing on mobile might prove to be a bit difficult.

However there are some downsides.

Demerits:
- Upgrades are difficult.
- There are artifacts for transport between formats.
- If the HTML file is ever corrupted then it would cause damage to all data. It would be very difficult to recover data once the file is corrupt.
