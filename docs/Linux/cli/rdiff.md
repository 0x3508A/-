Sources <https://github.com/rdiff-backup/rdiff-backup>

Inspiration <https://www.thanassis.space/Offline-rsync.html>

- Why `rdiff` and not `rsync` is explained here.
- Local **[PDF](./rdiff/thanassis-space-rdiff.pdf)** copy of the same.

However with the advent of more faster tools like [`rclone`](./rclone.md) and [`restic`](./restic.md) these have been replaced.
