# `yt-dlp` Video Downloader
Better fork of the famous YoutTube Downloader

`yt-dlp` is a [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl) fork based on the now inactive [youtube-dlc](https://github.com/blackjack4494/yt-dlc). The main focus of this project is adding new features and patches while also keeping up to date with the original project.
