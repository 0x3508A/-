# `mkcert` Tool - Secure Localhost

`mkcert` is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration.

<https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert>

Using certificates from real certificate authorities (CAs) for development can be dangerous or impossible (for hosts like `example.test`, `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`), but self-signed certificates cause trust errors. Managing your own CA is the best solution, but usually involves arcane commands, specialized knowledge and manual steps.

`mkcert` automatically creates and installs a local CA in the system root store, and generates locally-trusted certificates. `mkcert` does not automatically configure servers to use the certificates, though, that's up to you.

```sh
$ mkcert -install
Created a new local CA üí•
The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! ü¶ä

$ mkcert example.com "*.example.com" example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
 - "example.com"
 - "*.example.com"
 - "example.test"
 - "localhost"
 - "127.0.0.1"
 - "::1"

The certificate is at "./example.com+5.pem" and the key at "./example.com+5-key.pem" ‚úÖ
```

## Installing

```sh
sudo pacman -S mkcert
```
