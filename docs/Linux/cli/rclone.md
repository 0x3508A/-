## Local Folder to Sync to Cloud - Command
```sh
rclone sync ./ToSyncFolder/ DropboxEncrypt:ToSyncFol -v
```

`ToSyncFol` is the name of the storage folder in the cloud.
The `-v` option describes whats uploaded to cloud.

## List Full Directories on Cloud - Command
```sh
rclone lsf DropboxEncrypt:
```

Shows contents of the directory. The `:` here is essential to give details about all *containers* under the `DropBoxEncrypt` connection.

## Sync Local Folder from Cloud - Command
```sh
rclone sync DropboxEncrypt:ToSyncFol ./ToSyncFolder/ -v
```

The `-v` option describes whats downloaded from cloud.

## Delete a Container Directory - Command
```sh
rclone pruge DropboxEncrypt:mq
```

Here `mq` is the location that is described `lsf` command([List Full Directories](#list-full-directories-on-cloud---command)).

## `rclone` for Android

<https://github.com/x0b/rcx>

## `rclone` for Windows

We would need to install the Following:

```batch
winget install -e --id Rclone.Rclone
winget install -e --id kapitainsky.RcloneBrowser
```

These two would ensure you have both the
command line `rclone` as well as the
GUI support of `RcloneBrowser`.

Finally if you wish to **mount the `rclone` volumes** then:

```batch
winget install -e --id WinFsp.WinFsp
```

!!! note "Windows File System Proxy"
	WinFsp is system software that provides runtime and development
	support for custom file systems on Windows computers.
	In this sense it is similar to FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace),
	which provides the same functionality on UNIX-like computers.
