# Windows Guest under KVM

## Windows Guest Copy  Paste Clipboard Functionality

In order to make sure that the copy & paste works between the host and guest,
we need to install **Windows guest tools** = [spice-guest-tools](https://www.spice-space.org/download/windows/spice-guest-tools/spice-guest-tools-latest.exe).

!!! note "Spice Server as Display"
    This only works if your Display is set to **`spice Server`**.
