# V3 Third with single Script

This is kept in a script code tag to help editing it here.
Later when needed use this as a text script file.

The concept here is to attach functions to `bash` shell during install.
These functions intern would help to do various installation activities.

**[Script](./ArchLinux-install-v3-script.txt)** - Text version of the Script.
