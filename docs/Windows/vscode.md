# Visual Studio Code : VSCode

> Microsoft's most popular code editor.

There is an open source alternative **[VSCodium](../Linux/vscodium.md)** for this.

## Workspace Trust settings

- `CTRL + SHIFT + P` Open *Command Palette*
- Type **"Manage Workspace Trust"**

Reference:

- <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust#_trusting-a-workspace>

## Prevent VS Code from connecting to the Internet

Add the following Setting into your `settings.json` file:

```json
    "http.proxy": "https://127.0.0.1:65000", // Prevent Internet connection
```

Edit this part:

[![VS Code Proxy Bypass Settings](./vscode/vscode-proxy-bypass.png)](./vscode/vscode-proxy-bypass.png)

**And you get rid of the pesky telemetry from VS Code altogether !!**

### Restore Updates

Now to enable updates you need to close all files.

And safely comment out the *proxy setting* in `settings.json`, or remove it from the UI.

## Regex to replace wiki-links in Markdown

!!! note
    This is done using the *Regex replace* in **VS Code**.

### Regex to Replace the Wiki-links alone

```regex
\[\[(.*)\|(.*)\]\]
[$1]($2.md)
```

The first line would select the two parts of Wiki-Links.

Second line would convert it into a normal Markdown link.

There is another one where only *one piece* is mentioned.

```regex
\[\[(.*)\]\]
[$1]($1.md)
```

### Regex to Replace Image Wiki-links

```regex
!\[\[(.*)\|(.*)\]\]
$1\n![$1]($2.md)
```

This would make sure that the Alt comment is shown as well as embedded for the missing image.
