## What is on your Pico?

If you have forgotten what has been programmed into your **Raspberry Pi Pico**, and the program was built using our **Pico C/C++ SDK**, it will usually have a name and other useful information embedded into the binary. You can use the `Picotool` command line utility to find out these details. Full instructions on how to use `Picotool` to do this are available in our 'getting started' documentation.

## Debugging using another Raspberry Pi Pico - `picoprobe`

It is possible to use one **Raspberry Pi Pico** to debug another Pico. This is possible via `picoprobe`, an application that allows a Pico to act as a USB → SWD and UART converter. This makes it easy to use a Pico on non-Raspberry Pi platforms such as Windows, Mac, and Linux computers where you don’t have GPIOs to connect directly to your Pico. Full instructions on how to use `Picoprobe` to do this are available in our 'getting started' documentation.

## Resetting Flash memory

Pico's `BOOTSEL` mode lives in read-only memory inside the `RP2040` chip, and can't be overwritten accidentally. No matter what, if you hold down the `BOOTSEL` button when you plug in your Pico, it will appear as a drive onto which you can drag a new `UF2 file`. There is no way to brick the board through software. However, there are some circumstances where you might want to make sure your Flash memory is empty. You can do this by dragging and dropping a special `UF2 binary` onto your Pico when it is in mass storage mode.

## Starting with C/C++ SDK

### 1. Setup SDK

```sh
git clone https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
cd pico-sdk/
git submodule update --init
cd
```

### 2. Set the SDK Path

Possibly add this to `bashrc`:

```bash
export PICO_SDK_PATH=$HOME/pico-sdk
```

### 3. Get the Examples

```sh
git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples.git
```
= AT for `Picoprobe` using pico
