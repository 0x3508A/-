### STOMP : The Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol

Home Page <https://stomp.github.io/>

Viable alternative to MQTT.

#### What is it?

STOMP is the Simple (or Streaming) Text Orientated Messaging Protocol.

STOMP provides an interoperable wire format so that STOMP clients can communicate with any STOMP message broker to provide easy and widespread messaging interoperability among many languages, platforms and brokers.
Simple Design

#### Simple Design

STOMP is a very simple and easy to implement protocol, coming from the HTTP school of design; the server side may be hard to implement well, but it is very easy to write a client to get yourself connected. For example you can use Telnet to login to any STOMP broker and interact with it!

Many developers have told us that they have managed to write a STOMP client in a couple of hours to in their particular language, runtime or platform into the STOMP network. So if your favored language/runtime of choice does not offer a good enough STOMP client don't be afraid to write one.

#### Specification V1.2

Got it from Hackaday <https://hackaday.com/2023/10/24/learning-about-capacitors-by-rolling-your-own-electrolytics/>

An excellent Video explaining the process:
