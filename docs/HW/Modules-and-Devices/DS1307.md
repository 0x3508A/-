## Low Power Modifications to DS1307 Module

The common DS1307 Module is as shown:

This module has several parts that cause dissipation.

Here is a schematics for this Module:

- We can clearly see the Removal of **R5** and **D1** is needed. This would disable a charge circuit which we would never use.
- Next **R6** and **R4** are not useful at all. They drain the battery. Instead we need to short the **R6** to have better connection to Battery.

Here is a picture showing these modifications:
