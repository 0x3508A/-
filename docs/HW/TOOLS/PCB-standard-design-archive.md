# PCB Standard Design Archive

This document list the set of **artifacts** that needs to shared
upon *completion of the Hardware project and its production*.

Here are directories where the respective **artifacts** need to located:

1. Design
      - Schematics File (Actual for CAD Tool)
      - Schematics PDF
      - Schematics BOM with all parts and Population specified
      - (Optional) Schematics Symbol Library in CAD Tool
      - PCB File (Actual for CAD Tool)
      - PCB Assembly (All Layers or TOP and Bottom)
      - PCB BOM with Non Populated Parts Removed
      - Gerber in R274X with Drill Details
      - Pick and Place file for PCB Assembly
      - PCB Specification file for PCB Assembly and Manufacturing
      - BOM used for Manufacturing
      - Any other CAD Tool related files needed to maintain the design project
      - (Optional) 2D Draft or drawing output for design
      - (Optional) 3D Render and Parts for the PCB
2. Manufacturing
      - BOM used for Manufacturing
      - Gerber in R274X with Drill Details
